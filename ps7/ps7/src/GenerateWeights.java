	/**
	 * Generates a connected, undirected, weighted graph.  Note that
	 * the result is a symmetric adjacency matrix where each value
	 * represents an edge weight.  (An edge weight of 0 represents
	 * a non-edge.)
	 * 
	 * Note that the arrays are zero-based, so vertices are numbered
	 * [0..vertexCount).  
	 * 
	 * The connectivity parameter specifies how many times a random
	 * spanning tree should be added to the graph.  Note that a 
	 * value greater than 1 will probably result in a cycle, but it
	 * is not guaranteed (especially for tiny graphs)
	 * 
	 * For language independence, the random number generation is
	 * done using a linear feedback shift register with a cycle
	 * length of 2^31-1.  (Bits 27 and 30 are xor'd and fed back.)
	 * (Note:  2^31-1 is prime which is useful when generating
	 * pairs, triples, or other multi-valued sequences.  The
	 * pattern won't repeat until after 2^31-1 pairs, triples, etc.
	 * are generated.)
	 * 
	 * Finally, the runtime of this generation is O(v) in connectivity,
	 * or k*v*connectivity.
	 * 
	 * @param seed  any positive int
	 * @param vertexCount any int greater than 1  
	 * @param minWeight   any positive int
	 * @param maxWeight   any int greater than minWeight
	 * @param connectivity the overall connectedness of the graph, min 1
	 * @return the weighted adjacency matrix for the graph
